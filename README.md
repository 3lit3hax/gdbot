Hey!

This is one of my first projects, so the code is probably not gonna be the best, and there will be bunch of bugs, however, I am trying to get better at programming.

What it does:
- Loads Geometry Dash accounts from a text file, and uses them to like/dislike user levels/comments/profiles.
- Uses accounts to send demon rates to potentially influence demon level ratings.

Requirements:
- Python (latest version, others untested)
- Packages: tkinter and requests

You can run:
"pip install tkinter, 'requests[socks]'"
if you would like to install the requirements

In order to make the bot work, you need real player accounts, and they must be placed in a text file.
The formatting is specific. Here is example formatting:

username:password:userid:

Lets say you have 2 accounts, with the usernames as 3lit3hax1 and 3lit3hax2, with the passwords 12345678, and the userids 00000001 and 00000002, here is what the accounts.txt file might look like:

3lit3hax1:12345678:00000001:3lit3hax2:12345678:00000002:

Thats pretty much it, if you need help or want to ask questions or report bugs, add my discord: 3lit3hax
